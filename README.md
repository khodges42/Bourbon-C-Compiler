Coming fresh out that Pyrex pot

Black Air Force 2s and the White Sox

Fitted on my forehead, try me, go 'head

I'll bring out the polka dots, put Kwame on your forehead

Yeah, it's the new king of everything

And bitches don't say no to me, I'm like a wedding ring

Maybe it's how I pour that Patron

Maybe it's how I smell of Paris Hilton Cologne

Maybe it's how I write shit when I'm in the zone

And I'm sick of jobs, leave me alone

And tell Dr. Dre to pick up a phone

Before I climb through his window like, ", I'm home!"

Running the rock like OJ,  it's a throwback

Fuck a Aston Martin, show me where the stove at

Get a jar, some baking soda,  hold that

The world is my grandma's kitchen, time to cook crack
